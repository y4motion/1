The AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to evolving an MVP application into a more feature-rich and aesthetically refined product. Initially, the focus was on significant UI/UX redesigns, implementing a glassmorphism theme, and expanding backend capabilities for e-commerce essentials like stock, orders, and payment methods. Key UI changes included relocating the LVL menu and overhauling the marketplace product cards with Pinterest-style layouts and interactive elements.

Subsequently, the engineer addressed user feedback on card aesthetics, refining icon placement, implementing specific hover effects, and ensuring theme compatibility across various UI components. A major feature addition involved developing a complete cart and checkout flow, including a custom toast notification and a sliding quick-cart panel. The latest work centered on revamping the authentication modal to align with the application's unique design language, integrating social login placeholders, and ensuring theme responsiveness. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving in adapting to specific design nuances and functional requirements.

The overarching goal is to develop a minimalist, modern gaming/tech e-commerce marketplace, drawing inspiration from wegic.ai's aesthetic, characterized by dark backgrounds, glassmorphism, and interactive UI.

**Completed Features (Phase 1.5 & Initial Phase 2):**
- Minimalist header with LVL button, hero section, product categories, mouse-hover effects, language/theme switch.
- Gamified LVL user menu (relocated from right header to left logo/power button).
- Robust FastAPI/MongoDB backend for user authentication, real-time cart, basic messaging, and CMS.
- Dynamic MarketplacePage with a centered search bar under MINIMAL MARKET, combined featured chips/view options, Pinterest-style product cards (4 per row, larger, hover expansion with quick buy, image carousels, title below photo), Apple-style price/buy tags (white matte acrylic pulsing price, purple pulsing buy button on hover).
- Subtle interaction icons (rating, likes, share) below the card (later refined and repositioned).
- Floating FILTERS button (scroll-following) and a sliding filter panel that pushes content, with tech-related categories.
-  and  redesigned for quick purchases without registration, dark purple theme, 3-column layout, and integration of stock/pre-order logic.
- Backend support for stock management (, , ,  fields in ).

**Ongoing/Recently Completed Refinements:**
- Product Cards: Rating displayed above card (small, numeric, slightly overlapping, white minimalist). Heart icon (wishlist) and rating positioned miniature, partially outside card contour at the bottom right. Heart turns red acrylic on hover/if in wishlist.
- Sharing: Removed from initial product card view, moved to  and .
- Header: LVL menu text made white in dark theme for readability. Mouse follower effect removed.
- Filters:  section removed. All filter elements (input fields, buttons) made visible and readable in light theme, with unified hover effects.
- Header Right Section: Login button replaced with a human icon. Cart icon moved to the far left of the right header group, displaying an item count badge.
- Cart & Checkout Flow: Implementation of an Added to Cart toast notification (bottom-right, minimalist, purple accents, auto-closing with a large cursor-following close button). Dedicated  (requiring authorization) and  (with payment integration placeholders).
- Quick Cart Panel: A sliding panel from the right in the header for quick cart overview, item removal, adding to wishlist/bags, and creating custom product bags.
- AuthModal: Added Remember Me checkbox, social login placeholders (Google, Apple, Yandex, VK), logout option, and ability to switch between login/register. Currently being restyled to match the site's primary hover/glassmorphism aesthetic, removing purple except for the main login button.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently working on refining the  component. The user explicitly requested to restyle this login/registration menu to perfectly match the site's existing hover effects, glassmorphism, acrylic, and liquid polymorph styles. This includes ensuring buttons and their highlights align with the overall site aesthetic and that the modal functions correctly across different themes. A specific directive was to remove the purple color from all elements within the modal, reserving it exclusively for the main Login button.

This follows the successful implementation of the core  functionality, including real registration/login, a Remember Me checkbox, and placeholders for social login options (Google, Apple, Yandex, VK). The previous task involved completing the  and associated backend routes for wishlist, saved items, and custom bags. The work immediately before this summary request involves modifying the  file to apply the requested styling changes.
