<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user's primary goal is to build a hyper-stylized, atmospheric website called Ghost Protocol.

In this session, the user completely redirected the development focus towards a radical and iterative visual overhaul of the application's core interface. The initial tasks from the previous session were set aside.

The main work revolved around two major features, both involving multiple, detailed design iterations driven by user feedback and reference images:

1.  **Living Background Implementation & Removal:** The user first requested to add depth to the flat black background. This led to a multi-stage implementation of a  component:
    *   It started as a subtle ASCII-art parallax layer.
    *   Evolved into a dot-matrix/dithering pattern.
    *   Became a complex canvas-based animation of ASCII characters forming shapes (Koi fish, ghosts).
    *   Finally, the user was dissatisfied with all attempts and requested the entire feature be removed.

2.  **Neural Hub Menu Creation & Perfection:** The user then initiated the development of the Ghost OS Menu, a complex user profile and navigation modal. This feature went through a rapid and transformative design journey:
    *   **v1: Standard Sidebar:** A basic slide-out panel.
    *   **v2: Floating Island:** A Spatial UI card floating in the center.
    *   **v3: Command Center:** A wide, two-panel dashboard to feel more like a control center.
    *   **v4: Tactical FUI:** A Fictional User Interface in a monochrome-plus-cyan hacker style, with dense technical details.
    *   **v5: Holographic Finish:** Added glow, material, and lighting effects to the Tactical FUI.
    *   **v6: Acrylic Ghost (Final):** A complete reskin away from the gamer aesthetic to a premium, clean, monochrome frosted glass style, inspired by brands like Nothing and Teenage Engineering. This final design was approved.

The user's final request was to apply a final polish to the Acrylic Ghost menu and then implement a new  component to extend this clean, premium aesthetic to the entire site.

**User's preferred language**: Russian (Русский)

**what currently exists?**
- A full-stack application (React/FastAPI/MongoDB).
- **Neural Hub:** A sophisticated, non-sidebar menu () built in the final Acrylic Ghost style. It's a wide, floating, two-panel dashboard featuring a monochrome palette, frosted glass/blur effects, soft white glows, and refined typography. It is triggered by a new  button in the header.
- **Header Refactoring:** The  component has been significantly refactored. The entire legacy LVL Menu and its state management have been removed and replaced with the integration for the new Neural Hub.
- **Cleaned Features:** The Code Abyss background and Chaos to Order entry animations were created, iterated upon, and then completely removed from the codebase (,  components) at the user's request. The homepage background is currently plain black.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Applying the final polish to the  component and beginning the creation of the  component.
    - **Polish :** Using monospaced fonts for numbers/stats and adding a subtle, soft white glow to the container's border to complete the Acrylic Ghost look.
    - **Create :** Building a new global background component featuring a white fog effect (large, blurred, low-opacity white circles), a noise/grain texture, and a vignette to match the new design language.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. The agent should take a screenshot after implementing the background and polishing the menu to verify the final, cohesive visual style.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Review Widget Animation Verification (P1)**
  - **Description:** From the previous handoff, the user needs to confirm if the new, faster animation for the  expansion/collapse is satisfactory.
  - **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Issue 2:  Redesign Verification (P2)**
  - **Description:** From a previous handoff, the agent implemented a 1/3 width and upward-fading animation for the , but it was never visually verified.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Issue 3: Video Autoplay in Hero Section (P2)**
  - **Description:** A known issue where the background video doesn't autoplay reliably.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Issue 4: Zen Mode Scroll Bug (P2)**
  - **Description:** An old, deferred bug where scrolling in Zen Mode might reveal hidden elements.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Finalize Acrylic Ghost UI Overhaul (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** Create the  file and implement the white fog, noise texture, and vignette effects. Apply this component globally in  or the main layout file. Verify the final font and glow polishes on the already-updated .
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The application will have a cohesive, premium, and unique visual identity across all pages, unifying the new  menu with the rest of the site.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **(P1) Implement Expandable :** A missed requirement from a previous session.
    - **(P2) Phase 4: The Evolution (Interactivity):** Implement RPG-like mechanics:  (the lootbox system) and .
- **Future Tasks:**
    - AI-powered web crawler for updating product prices and stock.
    - User Trust/Rating System UI.
    - Modals for creating new Posts and Ideas in the Social Core.
    - Alternate Payment Systems (Tinkoff + Cryptomus).
    - Full Voice & Screen Share capabilities for support chat.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Neural Hub Creation & Iteration:** A complex modal menu () was designed and built from scratch. It was iteratively redesigned through six distinct visual styles (Sidebar, Floating Island, Command Center, Tactical FUI, Holographic, and the final **Acrylic Ghost**).
- **Header Refactoring:** The very large  file was heavily refactored to completely remove the old LVL Menu system and integrate the new  button that toggles the Neural Hub.
- **Feature Prototyping & Rejection:** The  feature was fully built out (including ASCII art, dot-matrix patterns, and canvas animations) and subsequently removed from the project at the user's request, cleaning up  and other related files.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Video Autoplay Issue:** The hero video often fails to load/play in the test environment.
- **Zen Mode Scroll Bug:** Scrolling down the page in Zen Mode might reveal elements that are supposed to be hidden.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Extreme Iterative UI Development:** The session was defined by building and completely discarding complex UI components based on rapid, evolving user feedback.
- **Style-Driven Development:** The agent implemented multiple distinct and complex aesthetic themes: ASCII art, dot-matrix, FUI (Fictional User Interface), and finally Acrylic Ghost (frosted glassmorphism).
- **Advanced CSS & Animation:** Extensive use of TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for , custom  shapes, color gradients, glows (), and custom keyframe animations (, ).
- **Major Component Refactoring:** The agent performed significant surgery on  to remove a large, obsolete menu system and cleanly integrate the new one.

**key DB schema**
- No changes made to the database schema.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : The final, approved Acrylic Ghost menu.
- : The trigger button for the menu.
- : The heavily modified header component.
- : The user's prompt for the background, which is now being implemented.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-  is extremely large and has undergone significant removal of code. It could be reviewed for dead code or opportunities for simplification.

**key api endpoints**
- No new API endpoints were created.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **You MUST respond in Russian.** The user is highly communicative and provides detailed feedback in Russian.
- **The Acrylic Ghost style is the new law.** This aesthetic (clean monochrome, frosted glass, soft white glows, premium materials) has been approved as the DNA of the brand. All future UI work must adhere to it.
- **Your immediate task is to finish the visual overhaul.** Complete the final polish on  (fonts, glow) and create and apply the  globally to unify the site's look and feel.
- **The user is highly visual and decisive.** Be prepared for rapid changes in direction. They appreciate when the agent understands and executes on high-level aesthetic concepts (e.g., FUI, Acrylic Ghost).

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **LATEST:** User approved the Acrylic Ghost design, calling it a victory. They requested a final micro-polish (monospaced fonts for numbers) and instructed the agent to implement the Atmospheric Void background to match the new style.
2.  User critiqued the previous Tactical FUI design as too aggressive, gamer, and not fitting the Minimal Mod brand aesthetic.
3.  Agent presented the final Holographic FUI design.
4.  User requested the Holographic Finish, asking to turn the schematic into a working device with glows, better materials, and a real avatar photo.
5.  Agent presented the Tactical FUI design.
6.  User critiqued the Command Center as looking like a mobile app on a desktop and being childish. They requested a radical transformation into a Tactical FUI with a monochrome palette and dense technical decor.
7.  Agent presented the Command Center v3 design.
8.  User critiqued the v2 Floating Hub as a UX failure and looking like a mobile list. They instructed the agent to transform it into a wide Command Center dashboard without scrolling.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- All pending tasks from the previous handoff (verifying  animation, implementing  changes) were superseded by the user's immediate and all-consuming focus on the complete visual overhaul of the background and main menu. They were not forgotten, but explicitly deprioritized by the user's new stream of requests.</analysis>
