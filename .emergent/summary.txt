The previous AI engineer successfully built a minimalist modern gaming/tech marketplace frontend, meticulously replicating the wegic.ai aesthetic. This involved extensive use of glassmorphism, pulsing effects, and minimalist typography. Key features like a mouse-hover blur effect, multi-language support (EN/RU), and dark/light theme switching were implemented. The engineer also developed an expanded user menu with gamification elements like achievements, daily quests, and a spin wheel, and refined the header navigation. Challenges arose with ensuring consistent glassmorphism transparency across different UI elements due to conflicting CSS properties and a JSX structural error, which were debugged and resolved iteratively. The work concluded with the user approving the frontend MVP and detailing requirements for Phase 2: Full-Stack Integration, which the AI engineer is now planning.

The project's goal is to create a super modern, light, and minimalist e-commerce marketplace for gaming and tech gear, entirely replicating the aesthetic of wegic.ai. This includes a dark, textured background, extensive acrylic/glassmorphism elements, large, bold white typography, and interactive objects appearing as plain text until hovered, then displaying a subtle semi-transparent outline.

The homepage features a minimalist header with a pulsing Power Button logo (dual purpose: Home & Catalog access), dedicated HOME, MARKETPLACE, RESTOCK links (text-only, outline on hover), and a permanent glassmorphism LVL button for user account access. The hero section contains a pulsing RUNNING TO UPGRADE... text and an acrylic search dialog. Product categories and a minimalist footer complete the main page.

Later requirements expanded to include a mouse-hover light/blur effect, a language switcher (EN/RU with translations), and a theme switcher (Dark/Light mode, with light theme adapting the minimalist/acrylic design). The user menu (LVL button) was enhanced with gamified features: Achievements, Daily Quests, a Spin Wheel (weekly access, bonus after purchase), Inventory/Wallet, Quick Actions, Social features, and Progress/Statistics. All menu elements and the catalog dropdown were redesigned with minimalist glassmorphism and animated vertical lists.

Phase 2, now approved, focuses on full-stack integration:
1.  **Backend Setup**: Robust framework and production-ready MongoDB database.
2.  **LVL System Full Implementation**: User Authentication (registration, login, sessions), real-time cart, basic internal messaging.
3.  **Content Management System (CMS) Integration**: Admin/Moderator panel for products, categories, users, with a moderation workflow.
4.  **Product Data Flow**: Connect frontend to live database, replacing mock data.
5.  **Additional Features**: Google, Yandex, Apple quick registrations leading to full registration; a powerful, hidden admin panel; email notifications for order status/payments; real-time LVL menu notifications; user order history; and a wishlist/favorites feature.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application, responsible for setting up routing and integrating global contexts.
    -   **Changes**: Initially configured with a basic Home route. Updated to include , , and  components for , , and . Later wrapped with  and integrated .
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Implements the main navigation bar, including the logo, navigation links, language switcher, theme switcher, and the LVL user menu.
    -   **Changes**: Extensively modified across multiple iterations. Initially created with basic navigation. Later added language (EN/RU) and theme switchers (Dark/Light). Consolidated navigation links as per user requirements. Implemented the LVL button with permanent glassmorphism. Continuously refined to ensure consistent glassmorphism effect, correct alignment, and dynamic content for the user menu (achievements, quests, spin wheel, inventory) and the vertical catalog dropdown. Debugged and refactored multiple times to fix transparency and structural JSX issues.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Displays the hero section with pulsing text, search dialog, and product categories.
    -   **Changes**: Created to match wegic.ai aesthetic, including pulsing text and glassmorphism search bar. Updated to use  translations for static text.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores mock data for frontend development, simulating product listings, user achievements, quests, and spin wheel logic.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created with mock product data. Later expanded to include mock data for user gamification features (achievements, daily quests, spin wheel logic for weekly access/post-purchase bonus).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines the core glassmorphism and aesthetic styles, including blur effects, background transparencies, and animations.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to create the frosted, semi-transparent appearance for various elements. Adapted for both dark and light themes, including specific  and  values. Added enhanced pulsing animations and ice effects. Crucially, it defines the  class used for consistent transparency.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides a React Context for managing the application's theme (dark/light mode).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just finalized the extensive frontend development, achieving a pixel-perfect replication of the wegic.ai aesthetic, complete with dynamic features like theme switching, multi-language support, a mouse-follower effect, and a gamified user menu. The last significant challenges involved resolving inconsistencies in the glassmorphism effect between the catalog dropdown and the user menu, which required iterative debugging of CSS properties like  and , and ultimately addressing a structural JSX error where the catalog was incorrectly nested within the user menu. This required temporarily simplifying the user menu, fixing the JSX structure, and then restoring its full content. The application is currently in a state where the frontend is fully functional and visually aligned with all requirements. The user has provided MVP Final Approval for Phase 1.5 and given detailed requirements for Phase 2: Full-Stack Integration. The AI engineer has just confirmed understanding these requirements, including specific requests for social logins, a powerful admin panel, and various notification and user management features. The immediate next step is to formulate a detailed plan for executing Phase 2.
