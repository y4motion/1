<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user's goal is to build a hyper-stylized, atmospheric website called Ghost Protocol. The project has evolved from a static page design to a fully dynamic Kinetic Dot-OS interface, inspired by designers like Howard.le and the 'Nothing' brand aesthetic.

The most recent user requests are two-fold and represent a massive expansion of the project's scope:
1.  **Ghost OS Dashboard (Complete Overhaul):** Transform the entire homepage into a Living Desktop that assembles on load, featuring a Zen Mode for a minimalist view, a Sonic Tuner for ambient sounds, and a Telemetry Bar for system stats. This involved integrating several previously unused components into a single, cohesive, animated system.
2.  **The Social Core (New Epic):** Build a massive social layer within the application, divided into two core modules:
    *   **The Network:** A content feed system similar to DTF/Instagram for users to share posts, guides, and builds.
    *   **The Consensus:** A King of the Hill idea-voting system with a full-fledged internal economy based on Resource Points (RP), where users pay to submit and vote on ideas.

**User's preferred language**: Russian (Русский)

**what currently exists?**
- A full-stack application (React/FastAPI) with a highly stylized frontend.
- **Ghost OS Dashboard:** The  has been completely rebuilt into a dynamic dashboard featuring multiple animated kinetic widgets (, , , , , , etc.). A Zen Mode toggle (using Zustand for global state) and a Sonic Tuner are implemented.
- **Social Core Backend:** The entire backend for the Network and Consensus features is **complete**. This includes:
    - Pydantic models for posts, ideas, and leaderboards (, , ).
    - Service logic for business rules, including the RP economy (, , ).
    - FastAPI routes with both authenticated and optional-authentication endpoints (, , ). All backend APIs have been tested with  and are functional.
- **Social Core Frontend Scaffolding:** All necessary files for the frontend have been created but are empty placeholders:
    - Page: 
    - Components: , ,  located in .

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Scaffolding the frontend architecture for the new Social Core feature. The agent successfully created all the necessary placeholder files (pages, components, CSS, index) and was about to integrate the new community routes into the main  file.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N (Frontend not built yet)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. After implementation, the agent must test:
    1.  The new  hub page and its sub-components (, ).
    2.  The Community Pulse widget's integration and functionality on the homepage.
    3.  End-to-end flow: creating a post/idea and seeing it appear in the feed/list by calling the working backend APIs.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Implement the Social Core Frontend (P0)**
  - **Description:** Build the user interface for the Network (content feed) and Consensus (idea voting) features, and integrate the Community Pulse widget onto the homepage.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Issue 2: Implement Visual Correction Pass (P1)**
  - **Description:** The user has provided a detailed prompt for a major visual cleanup to align the site more closely with the strict Nothing OS aesthetic. This involves enforcing monochrome icons, using abstract patterns for category backgrounds instead of photos, and redesigning the .
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Issue 3: Zen Mode Scroll Bug (P2)**
  - **Description:** The agent noted that while Zen Mode correctly hides elements in the visible viewport, components further down the page (like  and ) might still appear if the user scrolls. This needs to be verified and fixed to ensure Zen mode affects the entire page.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Issue 4: ProductCard Expanded Panel Robustness (P2)**
  - **Description:** An old, low-priority task from a previous session to verify the stability of the hover panel on product cards in the marketplace.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Build the Social Core Frontend UI (P0)**

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Full-Stack Feature Development:** Building features from backend (FastAPI models, services, routes) to frontend (React components, state management).
- **Advanced :** Use of , , , and state-driven animations ( prop) to create complex, fluid UIs.
- **Global State Management:** Using  to manage UI state () that affects multiple, disparate components across the application.
- **Internal Economy Design:** Implementation of a points-based system (RP) to gate actions (creating/voting on ideas), creating value and preventing spam.
- **Optional API Authentication:** Using a utility () to create endpoints that can be accessed publicly but provide enhanced data for authenticated users.

**key DB schema**
- **network_posts:** 
- **consensus_ideas:** 
- **monarchs:** 

**changes in tech stack**
- **:** Added for global state management.
- **:** Added for handling ambient audio presets in the Sonic Tuner.

**key api endpoints**
- : Fetch posts for the Network feed (public).
- : Create a new post (auth required).
- : Fetch ideas for the Consensus list (public).
- : Create a new idea, costs 500 RP (auth required).
- : Vote on an idea, costs 50 RP (auth required).
- : Get user leaderboards (public).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **You MUST respond in Russian.**
- Your immediate and highest-priority task is to **build the frontend for the Social Core**. The backend is already finished, tested, and ready to be used.
- Start by implementing the routing in , then build out the UIs in  and .
- Once the Social Core frontend is complete, the next task is the **Visual Correction** pass, with instructions saved in . Do not start it before finishing the current task.
