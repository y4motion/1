<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user's goal is to build a hyper-stylized, atmospheric website with a deep, sophisticated user progression and rating system called Ghost Protocol. Initially focused on a Cartenon Temple aesthetic for the  page, the project has evolved through multiple phases defined in , now adopting a Toriki / Future Minimal / Japandi Tech style.

The latest user request is a major UI overhaul for the Home and  pages to a style named Kinetic Dot-OS, inspired by the animated UX of Howard.le and the minimalist dot matrix aesthetic of the 'Nothing' brand. This involves creating new, isolated live widgets that float and animate with spring physics, transforming static pages into a dynamic dashboard, while ensuring existing pages like the marketplace are not affected.

**User's preferred language**: Russian (Русский)

**what currently exists?**
- A full-stack application (React/FastAPI) with a complete Ghost Protocol backend, including services for leveling, trust scores, and dynamic Living Legend titles (, ).
- **Phase 2 (Visual Core):** , , and  components are fully implemented and refined, providing a visual representation of a user's status based on their Trust Score.
- **Phase 3 (Mod Temple):** The  page has been completely rebuilt. It features:
    -  and  for atmospheric notifications and sound.
    - A Split Gate animation that reveals a Void Shop with levitating products.
    - A restored Ecosystem bento grid and a Monument header with brand-specific content.
    - A horizontal Origin Thread timeline at the bottom of the page with a custom neural pulse animation.
- A new directory  has been created to house the components for the new Kinetic Dot-OS UI.
- All component files for the Kinetic UI have been created but are not yet integrated: , , , , , and .

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Implementing the user's request for a Kinetic Dot-OS UI. The agent successfully followed the Isolation Protocol by creating a new  directory and scaffolding all the required new components within it. The immediate next step is to integrate these components into the  and .
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent must verify the new kinetic widgets on the  page and the homepage. Testing should focus on spring physics animations, the Floating Islands style, widget-specific interactions, and confirming no visual regressions on the  and  pages.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Complete the Kinetic Dot-OS UI Overhaul (P0)**
  - **Description:** Transform the static UI of the  page's 'Ecosystem' section and the entire homepage into a live dashboard. This involves implementing 'Floating Islands' for widgets, spring physics animations, and a monochrome/dot-matrix/red-accent aesthetic.
  - **Attempted fixes:** The agent has successfully created the file structure and empty components in , isolating them from the rest of the app.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
      1.  Open .
      2.  Replace the current Ecosystem bento grid with the new kinetic components:  and .
      3.  Open .
      4.  Rebuild its layout using the other new kinetic widgets: , , and .
      5.  Ensure all animations use  spring physics ().
      6.  Visually verify the new UI on both pages via screenshots.
      7.  **Crucially**, take screenshots of  and  to confirm no regressions have occurred.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will elevate the site's user experience from a standard web layout to a futuristic, dynamic, and highly stylized interface, aligning with the user's core vision.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Integrate Kinetic Widgets into ModPage (P0)**
  - **Where to resume:** Open  and replace the current JSX for the 'Ecosystem' section with the newly created  and  components from .
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The 'Ecosystem' section of the brand page will be the first part of the site to feature the new dynamic Kinetic Dot-OS UI.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **(P0) Rebuild HomePage.jsx with Kinetic Widgets:** After updating , overhaul the main homepage using , , and .
    - **(P1) Phase 4: The Evolution (Interactivity):** Implement RPG-like mechanics:  (the lootbox system) and .
    - **(P2) Ghost OS Menu:** Implement the Neural Hub menu concept, which was archived in .
- **Future Tasks:**
    - Implement full Voice & Screen Share capabilities for support chat.
    - Build out the User Trust/Rating System UI.
    - Develop social features: , , .
    - Integrate alternate Payment Systems (Tinkoff + Cryptomus).
    - Implement Performance Optimization.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Phase 2 & 3 Refinements:**
    - Fully implemented and refined  and  to match the user's highly detailed visual specifications.
    - Fully rebuilt  to include the Split Gate mechanic, Void Shop, audio feedback, system toasts, and restored brand content.
    - Overhauled the Origin Thread timeline to be horizontal, placed at the bottom, and animated with random neural pulses.
- **Kinetic Dot-OS Kick-off:**
    - Archived the user's Ghost OS Menu idea into  for later implementation.
    - Created an isolated directory () and all necessary component files for the new UI system, preparing for integration.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- ** Expanded Panel Robustness:** A P2 verification task from a previous session to check the stability of the hover panel on product cards. Status remains NOT STARTED.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Isolated Component Development:** Creating new UI systems in a dedicated, isolated directory () to prevent regressions in stable parts of the application. This is a critical safety protocol.
- **Advanced :** The Kinetic Dot-OS will rely heavily on  for spring physics (), layout animations (), and choreographed interactions.
- **UI as an OS:** A design philosophy treating the UI as a dynamic Operating System with live widgets, rather than a static page.
- **Aesthetic Synthesis:** A new style combining 's animation physics, the  brand's dot-matrix and monochrome/red-accent palette, and the existing Toriki / Future Minimal theme.

**key DB schema**
- No changes made in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
- No new libraries were added. The agent opted for the native Web Audio API () instead of  for reliability.

**All files of reference**
- : The master project plan.
- : The archived plan for the next-gen menu system.
- : The first page to be updated with the new kinetic widgets.
- : The next page to be overhauled.
- : The directory containing all the newly created components for the Kinetic Dot-OS.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- None. The current task explicitly avoids refactoring by creating new, isolated components.

**key api endpoints**
- None created in this session.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **You MUST respond in Russian.**
- **Your immediate task is to continue the Kinetic Dot-OS overhaul.** The component files are already created in . You need to integrate them into  first, then rebuild .
- **Follow the Isolation Protocol:** Do NOT modify any global components or files outside of  and . The  and  pages must remain untouched. Verify this with screenshots after your changes.
- The user's aesthetic is paramount. Adhere strictly to the principles of Floating Islands, spring physics, and the monochrome/dot-matrix/red-accent color scheme.
