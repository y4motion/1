<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user's goal is to build a hyper-stylized, atmospheric website called Ghost Protocol. The project has rapidly evolved through a series of ambitious, user-driven directives.

Initial work focused on creating immersive profile () and messaging () experiences from user-provided code. This was followed by a GLOBAL UNBOXING refactor to make the entire application layout full-width.

Subsequent requests included:
1.  A Holographic Comms Link redesign for .
2.  Implementing a synchronized, multi-level chat system between a mini-chat bar () and the full-screen messenger.
3.  Building two new, feature-rich pages from scratch:  (The Neural Feed) for social content and  for community voting.
4.  A full audit of all project systems, which uncovered a hidden, unintegrated RPG system and several deprecated components.

The current and most recent directive is **SYSTEM CONVERGENCE,** which focuses on integrating the discovered RPG mechanics into the user profile and cleaning up the codebase by deleting obsolete files. The user has explicitly forbidden any changes to the Marketplace components for now.

**User's preferred language**: Русский (Russian)

**what currently exists?**
- A full-stack application (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) with a completely full-width, immersive layout.
- : An immersive user profile page.
- : A globally-managed, holographic-style, full-screen messenger with a hierarchical structure for different chat types.
- : The active, floating mini-chat bar that can expand into the full .
-  (): A complex social feed page with a Masonry layout.
-  (): A complex page for community voting on features and bug reports.
- : A detailed audit document of all components, routes, and systems.
- An unintegrated RPG system (, ) discovered during the audit.
- All UI is driven by extensive mock data.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was executing the **SYSTEM CONVERGENCE** task. This task has two parts:
    1.  **RPG Integration:** Integrating the visual logic from  (3D rotating class artifacts) and  (dynamic Trust Score aura with glitch effects) into the main user profile, .
    2.  **Code Cleanup:** Deleting four specific deprecated or duplicate files.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing. The agent should use the  to view the  page (wherever  is rendered) to verify that the new RPG visuals (3D artifact, Trust Score aura) are correctly integrated.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Video Autoplay in Hero Section (P2)**
  - **Description:** A known, deferred bug where the background video doesn't autoplay reliably.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Issue 2: Zen Mode Scroll Bug (P2)**
  - **Description:** An old, deferred bug where scrolling in Zen Mode can reveal hidden elements.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete SYSTEM CONVERGENCE (P0)**
  - **Where to resume:** The agent has reviewed the source files (, , ). The next step is to modify  to incorporate the JSX and logic for the 3D class artifact and the trust score visualization. Following the integration, the agent must delete the four specified files.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The user profile will become more visually rich and dynamic, reflecting the discovered RPG mechanics. The codebase will be cleaner and easier to maintain.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **(P0) Finalize Cleanup & Redirects:** After deleting the old social components (, ), create redirects in  from the old routes (, ) to the new ones (, ).
    - **(P1) Integrate :** Integrate the ready-but-unused  component into  and/or  to fulfill the user's request for system optimization.
    - **(P1) The Armory (Marketplace Overhaul):** Begin work on the HOLOGRAPHIC SHOWROOM concept for the marketplace. This includes 3D levitating product cards, a Frequency Tuner filter panel, and a Quick View video preview. **Note:** The user has currently frozen work on the marketplace, so this should only be started after explicit user approval.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - Implement monetization hooks for profile customizations.
    - Implement Expandable .
    - Phase 4: The Evolution (Interactivity) - Implement  (lootbox system) and .
    - AI-powered web crawler for product prices.
    - Modals for creating new Posts and Ideas in the Social Core.
    - Alternate Payment Systems (Tinkoff + Cryptomus).
    - Full Voice & Screen Share capabilities for support chat.

**Completed work in this session**
- **GLOBAL UNBOXING:** Refactored the entire application to use a full-width layout, removing all fixed-width containers.
- **GhostMessenger Redesign & Integration:**
  - Redesigned the messenger into a Holographic Comms Link with a glass aesthetic.
  - Re-architected the chat system by making  a global component in .
  - Added an Expand button to the  mini-bar to open the full messenger.
  - Implemented a hierarchical дом с комнатами (house with rooms) structure within  to categorize chats (Trade, Guilds, Global, Support).
- **New Core Pages Created:**
  - ** ():** A sophisticated social feed with a Masonry layout, complex interactions (Resonance, Echoes, Awards), and algorithmic tabs.
  - ** ():** A community governance hub for voting on features, reporting bugs, and viewing a leaderboard.
- **System Audit:**
  - Performed a complete codebase audit and created .
  - Discovered and documented a hidden RPG system (Classes & Trust Score visuals) and identified several deprecated/duplicate components.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Duplicate Social Routes:** The new social pages (, ) have been created, but the old routes (, ) still exist and need to be redirected.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Global State via Custom Events:** Using  to trigger actions (like opening the global messenger) from decoupled components.
- **System Auditing & Discovery:** Proactively analyzing the codebase to map all systems, which led to the discovery of unintegrated RPG features and technical debt.
- **Complex UI from Prompts:** Rapidly building data-rich, functionally complex pages (, ) based on detailed user directives.
- **Component Consolidation:** The process of identifying duplicate functionality ( vs. ) and centralizing logic ( becoming a global component).

**key DB schema**
- No changes made.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.
