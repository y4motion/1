<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user's goal is to build a hyper-stylized, atmospheric website called Ghost Protocol. The project has evolved through several major phases, including designing a Kinetic Dot-OS interface, building a Social Core (content feed and voting system), establishing a data architecture for a PC Builder, and performing multiple, rapid design iterations on the homepage based on user feedback.

The most recent user requests involved a complete overhaul of the homepage's top section:
1.  **Hero Section Redesign:** The original starfield hero was completely removed and replaced with a full-screen video background.
2.  **Minimalist Search:** A highly custom, animated search input was designed and implemented below the hero video section after several iterations.
3.  **Homepage Component Cleanup:** The main  (with clock and focus button) and the  (with online user count) were completely removed.
4.  **Bento UI:** The functionality of the removed components (Zen Mode, Sonic Tuner) was re-implemented as smaller, self-contained bento tiles.
5.  **LiveTicker Redesign:** The news ticker component was redesigned to be smaller (1/3 width) and have a new vertical fade-out animation.

**User's preferred language**: Russian (Русский)

**what currently exists?**
- A full-stack application (React/FastAPI) with a highly customized and frequently iterated frontend.
- **Homepage:**
    - The  has been completely rebuilt to feature a video background and a custom-animated minimalist search input below the main viewport.
    - The  and  components have been entirely removed from the codebase.
    - New bento style widgets for Zen Mode and Ambient sound control exist in their place.
    - The  component has been refactored to be 1/3 width and use an upward-fading animation for its text.
- **PC Builder & Marketplace:** These sections are now fully functional, powered by a MongoDB database seeded with 48 real hardware components and their technical specifications. The API endpoints to serve this data are working.
- **Social Core:** The Network (content feed) and Consensus (idea voting) features are fully implemented, both backend and frontend, and have been tested.
- **Chat:** The application uses a single, modern chat component (). Deprecated chat components have been removed. The chat is configured to automatically open with a context-specific message on the PC Builder page.
- **Bug Fixes:** A critical navigation bug that caused a black screen when loading lazy-loaded pages has been resolved by removing a conflicting  component.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Redesigning the  component. The agent implemented the user's request to make it 1/3 width and change the animation to have text lines fade and move upwards.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Screenshot tool. The agent needs to take a screenshot of the homepage to visually verify that the  component is now 1/3 width and that the new upward fade animation is working as expected.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Verify  Redesign (P0)**
  - **Description:** The agent has implemented the code changes for the  but has not yet visually confirmed if they work correctly.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Issue 2: Video Autoplay in Hero Section (P2)**
  - **Description:** The background video in the  does not autoplay reliably in the testing environment, showing a black screen or a LOADING... message. The agent concluded this is a headless browser limitation, but the user experience is impacted.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Issue 3: Zen Mode Scroll Bug (P2)**
  - **Description:** An old, deferred bug where scrolling down the page in Zen Mode might reveal elements that are supposed to be hidden.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Issue 4: ProductCard Expanded Panel Robustness (P2)**
  - **Description:** An old, low-priority task to verify the stability of the hover panel on product cards in the marketplace.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Verify  Implementation (P0)**
  - **Where to resume:** Take a screenshot of the homepage.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** Confirmation that the  component now correctly occupies 1/3 of the container width and that its text items animate upwards with a fade-out effect.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **(P0) Implement Expandable :** The user requested the redesigned  be expandable. This part of the request was missed and needs to be implemented.
    - **(P1) Phase 4: The Evolution (Interactivity):** Implement RPG-like mechanics:  (the lootbox system) and .
    - **(P2) Ghost OS Menu:** Implement the Neural Hub menu concept from .
- **Future Tasks:**
    - AI-powered web crawler for updating product prices and stock.
    - User Trust/Rating System UI.
    - Modals for creating new Posts and Ideas in the Social Core.
    - Alternate Payment Systems (Tinkoff + Cryptomus).
    - Full Voice & Screen Share capabilities for support chat.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Social Core Frontend:** Implemented and tested the UI for the Network and Consensus features.
- **Data Architecture:** Seeded the database with real hardware data, enabling the PC Builder and Marketplace.
- **PC Builder Integration:** Connected the frontend PC Builder to the seeded data and fixed routing bugs.
- **Chat Cleanup & Enhancement:** Removed a deprecated chat component (), standardized on , and implemented context-aware auto-opening.
- **Critical Bug Fix:** Resolved a navigation issue that caused a black screen when loading pages.
- **Homepage Overhaul (Multiple Iterations):**
    - Replaced the hero section with a video background.
    - Designed and implemented a custom animated search bar after several user-driven revisions.
    - Removed the  and  components.
    - Created new bento widgets for Zen Mode and Sonic Tuner.
    - Refactored the  component's layout and animation.
- **Visual Correction Pass:** Implemented monochrome icons, abstract category backgrounds, and a redesigned .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Zen Mode Scroll Bug:** See All Pending/In progress Issue list.
- **ProductCard Expanded Panel Robustness:** See All Pending/In progress Issue list.
- **Video Autoplay Issue:** The hero video often fails to load/play in the test environment. The current implementation relies on a local file in  after a remote URL failed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Rapid Prototyping & Iteration:** The agent demonstrated the ability to quickly implement and discard multiple complex UI designs based on user feedback.
- **CSS Animation:** Use of  masks and  for advanced border animations. Staggered animations with  for text effects.
- **Component Lifecycle Debugging:** Identified and fixed a critical bug caused by a conflict between 's  and React's .
- **Code Cleanup:** Proactively identified and removed/isolated deprecated components (, ) to resolve conflicts and improve maintainability.
- **Database Seeding:** Modified a Python script to generate and insert production-like data into MongoDB, enabling development of data-dependent features.

**key DB schema**
- **products:**  (Now populated with 48 items)
- **network_posts:** 
- **consensus_ideas:** 

**changes in tech stack**
- No new packages, but a shift away from using  and complex  structures at the root level due to performance and rendering issues.

**All files of reference**
- : The file for the most recent and significant UI changes.
- : The component that was last being worked on.
- : Contains the main layout and was modified to remove components and adjust grid layouts.
- : Modified to fix the navigation bug and clean up component imports.
- : The script used to populate the database.
- : Specification for a completed task.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The video loading in  is not robust. It could be improved with better error handling, a more prominent manual play button, or by using a compressed video format hosted on a CDN.

**key api endpoints**
- : Fetches products from the now-populated database.
- : Fetches posts for the Network feed.
- : Fetches ideas for the Consensus list.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **You MUST respond in Russian.**
- Your first action should be to take a screenshot of the homepage to verify the  changes from the last step.
- The user's request to make the  **expandable** was missed. This should be your next implementation task (P0 priority) after verifying the current state.
- The user has a history of making rapid, drastic changes to the UI, especially the homepage. Be prepared to discard and rebuild components quickly based on feedback.
- The video in the hero section is a known issue; it doesn't load reliably in the test environment. Do not spend too much time debugging it unless explicitly asked by the user.
