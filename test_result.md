# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Users cannot switch to Light or Minimal Mod. 2) **MINIMAL MOD CSS NOT APPLYING**: [data-theme='minimal-mod'] CSS rules are being overridden by inline styles. Evidence: LVL menu has border-radius: 16px (should be 0), backdrop-filter: blur(30px) (should be none), badges have border-radius: 12px (should be 0), footer has backdrop-filter: blur(20px) (should be none). 3) **MONOSPACE FONT MISSING**: Components show system fonts instead of SF Mono/monospace in minimal-mod. 4) **INLINE STYLES OVERRIDE THEME**: Components use inline borderRadius/backdropFilter that override [data-theme] CSS. ROOT CAUSE: Either toggleTheme() state not propagating OR inline styles have higher specificity than theme CSS. FIXES NEEDED: 1) Debug ThemeContext.jsx toggleTheme() function and state propagation, 2) Remove inline borderRadius/backdropFilter from all components (Header, LVL menu, Footer, etc), 3) Replace inline styles with CSS classes for theme-dependent properties, 4) Add !important to critical minimal-mod rules or use higher specificity selectors, 5) Ensure data-theme attribute updates on document.documentElement.

Add conditional styling or CSS classes that change button text color to light (rgb(241,241,241)) when data-theme='minimal-mod'. **SCREENSHOTS**: All 8 pages captured showing current state in minimal-mod theme.
